# Test Specification: D-T-AN-GTX-002

**Test ID:** D-T-AN-GTX-002

**Test Name:** Analyser - Get Top X Entries Empty

**Source:** Developer

**Module:** Analyser

**Category:** Get Top X

**Related Requirements:**

*   D-14
*   D-21

**Purpose:**
This test verifies that the `_get_top_x_entries` method of the `Analyser` class correctly handles the case where an empty `Data` object is passed as input. It ensures that an empty list is returned when there are no entries to retrieve.

**Preconditions:**

*   1) An instance of the `Analyser` class has been created (using the `analyser` fixture).
*   2) An empty `Data` object has been created.

**Test Data:**

*   An empty `Data` object (created directly in the test function).

**Test Steps:**

1.  Create an empty `Data` object.
2.  Call the `_get_top_x_entries` method of the `Analyser` instance, passing the empty `Data` object and `top_x = 5` as input.
3.  Store the returned value in a variable named `top_x_entries`.

**Expected Results:**

*   1) The `_get_top_x_entries` method should return an empty list.

**Assertions:**

*   `assert top_x_entries == []`: Verifies that the returned list is empty, indicating that no entries were found (as expected with an empty `Data` object).

**Postconditions:**

*   The state of the `Analyser` instance is not modified by this test.
*   The `Data` object remains empty.

**Test Code:** `test_analyser.py::test_get_top_x_entries_empty`

**Status:** Pass

**Notes:**

*   This test relies on the `pytest` framework and uses the `analyser` fixture.
*   The test verifies that the `_get_top_x_entries` method correctly handles the edge case of an empty input `Data` object.
*   The `top_x` value (5 in this case) is arbitrary since there is no data, and we expect an empty list regardless of its value.
