# Test Specification: D-T-ORC-RUE-001

**Test ID:** D-T-ORC-RUE-001

**Test Name:** Orchestrator - Run Unexpected Exception

**Source:** Developer

**Module:** Orchestrator

**Category:** Run Unexpected Exception

**Related Requirements:**

*   D-21
*   D-22
*   D-23

**Purpose:**
This test verifies that if an exception other than `FriendlyException` is raised during the execution of the `run` method (e.g., during `read_csv`), the exception is not caught by the `run` method and is allowed to propagate. It also verifies that no error message is logged and that subsequent operations like `analyze`, `display_results`, and `export_csv` are not executed.

**Preconditions:**

*   1) Mocks are set up for `Logger`, `CSVHandler`, `Analyser`, and `Printer`.
*   2) An instance of `TestStatisticReadWrite` is created.

**Test Data:**

*   N/A (Exception is mocked)

**Test Steps:**

1.  Create an instance of `TestStatisticReadWrite`.
2.  Set up `mock_csv_handler.read_csv` to raise a `ValueError`.
3.  Call the `run` method within a `pytest.raises` context.

**Expected Results:**

*   1) `read_csv` should raise a `ValueError`.
*   2) The `run` method should not catch the `ValueError`.
*   3) The `ValueError` should propagate out of the `run` method.
*   4) No error message should be logged.
*   5) `analyze`, `display_results`, and `export_csv` should not be called.

**Assertions:**

*   `with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Some unexpected error"):`: Asserts that a `ValueError` with the expected message is raised.
*   `mock_logger.log_error.assert_not_called()`: Asserts that no error message is logged.
*   `mock_analyser.analyze.assert_not_called()`: Asserts that `analyze` was not called.
*   `mock_printer.display_results.assert_not_called()`: Asserts that `display_results` was not called.
*   `mock_csv_handler.export_csv.assert_not_called()`: Asserts that `export_csv` was not called.

**Postconditions:**

*   An unexpected exception (`ValueError`) has been raised and propagated.
*   No error message has been logged.
*   No further processing (analysis, display, export) has occurred.

**Test Code:** `test_test_statistic_read_write.py::test_run_unexpected_exception`

**Status:** Pass

**Notes:**

*   This test focuses on the behavior of the `run` method when an unexpected exception occurs.
*   It demonstrates that the `run` method does not have a generic `except` block to catch all exceptions.
*   `pytest.raises` is used to assert that a specific exception is raised.
