# Test Specification: D-T-CSV-RDC-008

**Test ID:** D-T-CSV-RDC-008

**Test Name:** CSV Handler - Read CSV Skip Lines With Incorrect Number Of Columns

**Source:** Developer

**Module:** CSV Handler

**Category:** Read CSV

**Related Requirements:**

*   D-1
*   D-3
*   D-4
*   D-21

**Purpose:**
This test verifies that the `CSVHandler.read_csv()` method correctly handles lines with an incorrect number of columns in the input CSV file. It checks that such lines are skipped during the parsing process, that appropriate information about the skipped lines is recorded in the `review_lines` list of the `Data` object, and that a warning message is logged for these lines.

**Preconditions:**

*   1) The `builtins.open` function is mocked using `mocker.mock_open` to simulate reading from a file with the specified `csv_content`.
*   2) The `os.path.isfile` function is mocked to always return `True`.

**Test Data:**

*   `csv_content`: A string representing the content of a CSV file with one line having an incorrect number of columns:
    ```csv
    Test case;Duration;Status
    R1\\TC1;10.5 sec;Passed
    R2\\TC2;5.2 min
    R3\\TC3;2 min;Failed
    ```

**Test Steps:**

1.  Create a mock file object using `mocker.mock_open` with the `csv_content`.
2.  Patch `builtins.open` to return the mock file object.
3.  Patch `os.path.isfile` to always return `True`.
4.  Create an instance of `CSVHandler` with a dummy file path ("dummy.csv").
5.  Call `csv_handler.read_csv()`.

**Expected Results:**

*   1) The `Data` object returned by `read_csv()` should contain 2 valid entries.
*   2) The `Data` object's `review_lines` list should contain 1 entry.
*   3) The entry in `review_lines` should indicate that line 3 was skipped due to having 2 columns instead of 3.

**Assertions:**

*   `assert data.get_size() == 2`: Asserts that the `Data` object contains 2 valid entries.
*   `assert len(data.review_lines) == 1`: Asserts that the `review_lines` list contains 1 entry.
*   `assert data.review_lines[0][0] == 3`: Asserts that the line number of the skipped line is 3.
*   `assert data.review_lines[0][1] == "2 columns instead of 3"`: Asserts that the reason for skipping the line is recorded correctly.

**Postconditions:**

*   The `Data` object is populated with the valid data read from the mocked CSV file.
*   Information about the skipped line is recorded in `review_lines`.
*   A warning message is logged for the skipped line.

**Test Code:** `test_csv_handler.py::test_read_csv_skip_lines_with_incorrect_number_of_columns`

**Status:** Pass

**Notes:**

*   This test relies on the `pytest` framework and the `pytest-mock` plugin (`mocker` fixture).
*   The test uses a mocked file object to isolate the `read_csv` method from the actual file system.
*   The test data includes a line with an incorrect number of columns to test the error handling logic.
