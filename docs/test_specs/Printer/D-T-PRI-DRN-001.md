# Test Specification: D-T-PRI-DRN-001

**Test ID:** D-T-PRI-DRN-001

**Test Name:** Printer - Display Results No Entries

**Source:** Developer

**Module:** Printer

**Category:** Display Results No Entries

**Related Requirements:**

*   D-15
*   D-17
*   D-18
*   D-21

**Purpose:**
This test verifies that the `display_results` method of the `Printer` class, when called with an empty `top_x_entries` list, correctly outputs the total duration, total test cases, status counts, and does not attempt to print a "Top X" entries section.

**Preconditions:**

*   1) A `Printer` instance is created.
*   2) The `capsys` fixture is available to capture output.

**Test Data:**

*   `analysis`: A dictionary containing the total duration, an empty list for `top_x_entries`, and dummy values for `test_case_counts` and `status_counts`.
    ```python
    analysis = {
        "total_duration": 12.345,
        "top_x_entries": [],
        "test_case_counts": (15, 12, 3),  # 15 total, 12 parsed, 3 skipped
        "status_counts": {"Pass": 8, "Fail": 4},
    }
    ```

**Test Steps:**

1.  Call the `display_results` method with the `analysis` data and `formatting=True`.
2.  Capture the output using `capsys.readouterr()`.

**Expected Results:**

*   1) The output should contain the total duration, formatted as "Total Duration: <value> seconds.".
*   2) The output should contain the total number of cases, parsed cases, and skipped cases formatted as "Total Amount of Cases: <total> (<parsed> Parsed, <skipped> Skipped)."
*   3) The output should contain the header "Status Counts (Parsed Cases Only):"
*   4) The output should contain the status counts for parsed cases.
*   5) The output should not contain a "Top X" entries section.

**Assertions:**

*   `assert "Total Duration: 12.345 Seconds." in out`: Asserts that the total duration is printed correctly.
*   `assert "Total Amount of Cases: 15 (12 Parsed, 3 Skipped)." in out`: Asserts that the total, parsed, and skipped case counts are printed correctly.
*   `assert "Status Counts (Parsed Cases Only):" in out`: Asserts that the status counts header is present.
*   `assert "Pass: 8" in out`: Asserts that the "Pass" status count is printed.
*   `assert "Fail: 4" in out`: Asserts that the "Fail" status count is printed.
*   `assert "Top" not in out`: Asserts that no "Top X" section is present in the output.

**Postconditions:**

*   The `display_results` method has been tested with an empty `top_x_entries` list.
*   The output generated by `display_results` has been verified to be correct.

**Test Code:** `test_printer.py::test_display_results_no_entries`

**Status:** Pass

**Notes:**

*   This test checks the edge case where there are no entries to display in the "Top X" section.
*   The test uses `capsys` to capture the output.
